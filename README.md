# what is the goal of this blog?

In the first place our goal is not to get "followers" or fame or entertain people.<br>
The idea is to create a place where we can put the things we made.
<br>
<br>
And maybe someone gets inspired or reuses our ideas :)

# what we are using:
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- "ajax"
- CSS3
- PHP7
- font awesome 4.7
